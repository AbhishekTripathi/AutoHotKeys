My Collection of AHK Scripts

### Scipts I Coded ###

* **Autoclick.ahk** - Sends a mouse click every 300ms if Capslock is on - Was used to auto click to get into RUST servers before the queue system was created.
	
* **ClickFast.ahk** - Clicks every 10ms when F8 is pressed - Was used for the Steam Summer Sale to get wormhole badge.
!

* **GUI MSGBOX.ahk** - GUI message box example

* **SetMic50.ahk** - Forces Mic input to 50% - Windows would auto adjust (in error) and the gain would go up to 100 and the sound would clip and sound terrible.  Was a Win8.1 issue that went away when I upgraded to Win10.

* **PushToTalk.ahk** - Binds Push to Talk functionality to the Capslock key, making the mic Muted unless Capslock is held down.  System Tray icon for visual indicator as well as audio feed back when you start and stop transmitting	

* **PushToMute.ahk** - Binds Push to Mute functionality to the Capslock key, making the mic Live unless Capslock is held down.  System Tray icon for visual indicator as well as audio feed back when you start and stop muting	


* **AlwaysOnTop.ahk** - CTRL+Space to make current window always on top, adds SysTray icon to turn on or off 'always-on-top'
